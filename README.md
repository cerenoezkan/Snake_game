## 🧩 Project Classes

1. **`Object` Class**  
  🔹 Abstract class to ensure all objects have `draw()` and `erase()` methods.

2. **`Point1` Class (Snake)**  
  🔹 Represents each body part of the snake. Handles movement and coordinates.

3. **`Point2` Class (Fruit)**  
  🔹 Manages fruit’s position and updates location when needed.

4. **`Fruit` Class**  
  🔹 Handles fruit-related logic like spawning and redrawing.

5. **`Snake` Class**  
  🔹 Controls movement, growth, collision logic, and drawing on screen.

6. **`Game` Class**  
  🔹 Manages the game loop, scoring, and game over conditions.
